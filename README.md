# Cloud Conformity Pipeline Scanner

<img src="images/Trend-Micro-Logo.png">

Pipeline scanner uses Cloud Conformity's [Template Scanner](https://www.cloudconformity.com/solutions/aws/cloudformation-template-scanner.html) to secure your CloudFormation templates **before** they're deployed.

## Requirements

* Have an [Cloud One Conformity](https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/business/products/hybrid-cloud/cloud-one-conformity.html) account. [Sign up for free trial now](https://www.cloudconformity.com/identity/sign-up.html) if it's not already the case!
* A cloud formation template to be scan.

## Usage

To use the script, specify the following required environment variables:
  * `cc_apikey` (Cloud One Conformity API KEY)
  * `cc_region` (Cloud One Conformity account region)
  * `templatePath` (Path of the template to be scanned)
  * `maxExtreme | maxVeryHigh | maxHigh | maxMedium | maxLow` (Choose one or more of the options and set a number of how many violations are accepted)

 **PS.: ALWAYS use secrets to expose your credentials!**

## GitHub Actions Example

Add an Action in your `.github/workflow` yml file to scan your cloud formation template with Cloud One Conformity.

```yml
name: My CI/CD Pipeline

on: 
  push:
    branches: 
      - main
      
jobs:      
    CloudFormation-Scan:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
          - name: Checkout
            uses: actions/checkout@v2
          - name: Cloud One Conformity Pipeline Scanner
            uses: raphabot/conformity-template-scanner-pipeline@version
            env:
              cc_apikey: ${{ secrets.apikey }}
              maxExtreme: 0
              maxVeryHigh: 1
              maxHigh: 3
              maxMedium: 5
              maxLow: 10
              cc_region: us-west-2
              templatePath: template/infrastructure.yaml
``` 

## Docker Container Example

To be able to scan your template using a Docker comtainer, follow the example below:

https://hub.docker.com/r/raphabot/conformity-template-scanner-pipeline

```bash
docker run -v /home/ec2-user/dynamotest.template:/app/dynamotest.template -e cc_apikey=$MYAPIKEY -e cc_region=$MYREGION -e maxExtreme=0 -e maxVeryHigh=0
-e maxHigh=0 -e maxMedium=0 -e maxLow=0 -e templatePath=infrastructure.yaml felipecosta09/conformity-template-scanner-pipeline:latest
```

**PS.: To be able to scan a local template from a machine or inside a pipeline, the parameter "-v" is required in the docker run command, the example specifies a local file being copied to the container that will scan the Cloud Formation template ```/home/ec2-user/dynamotest.template:/app/dynamotest.template```, where:**

* **/home/ec2-user/dynamotest.template** - Represent the absolute path of the local Cloud Formation template file to be scanned;
* **/app/dynamotest.template** - The path where the file will be copied **(ONLY CHANGE THE FILE NAME OF THE TEMPLATE)**;

## Node CLI Example

To run the scanner in the Node CLI, just set the envinronment variables before execute the node script:

```bash
cc_apikey=$MYAPIKEY cc_region=$MYREGION maxExtreme=0 maxVeryHigh=0 maxHigh=0 maxMedium=0 maxLow=0 templatePath=infrastructure.yaml node scan.js
```
